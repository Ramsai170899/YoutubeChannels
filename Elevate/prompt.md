"Write a deeply insightful script under 10 minutes, discussing the above topic as  insisting..... something like, i am telling it to myself..... The narrative should be engaging, logical, and thought-provoking, seamlessly connecting real-world philosophical insights with technical analogies.

The discussion should flow naturally, without feeling segmented, smoothly transitioning between fundamental concepts, real-world applications, and deeper reflections. Avoid a lecture-like toneâ€”make it conversational, immersive, and intuitive, ensuring that even complex ideas feel relatable.

Use critical thinking to explore different perspectives, occasionally questioning common assumptions. Introduce historical context or industry trends when relevant. Keep the pace engaging and maintain a strong hook throughout to ensure maximum audience retention.

Avoid unnecessary filler. Strictly no dialogue sections, no bullet points, and no segmented explanations. Maintain a single-flow narrative style that keeps the viewer immersed while effortlessly learning."



style should be like one telling things to oneself.
