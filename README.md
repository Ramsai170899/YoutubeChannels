## Points for good video editing :
1. make sure to use frames lessthan 3 seconds
2. make sure to use pop ups almost every 2 seconds to make sure attention is retained.
3. make sure to use sound design for almost all the popups in the video for better audio retention.
4. frames should have movement nearly for almost all the key words in the narration.
5. donot make the screen look clumsy at any point of time in the video.
6. make sure to use match and move transition for eye catchy movements in the video.
