## Order of Editing the video
1. Fill in the background for frames for entire audio
2. add the popup graphics for the entire video
3. add the text to emphasis using cloud or msg boxes.
4. add the sound design for all the places in the video
5. add the channel branding at the beginning and end of the video.


## Points for good video editing :
1. make sure to use frames lessthan 3 seconds
2. make sure the audio has smaller breaks in between where there is need for small gaps.
3. make sure to use pop ups almost every 2 seconds to make sure attention is retained.
4. make sure to use sound design for almost all the popups in the video for better audio retention.
5. frames should have movement nearly for almost all the key words in the narration.
6. donot make the screen look clumsy at any point of time in the video.
7. make sure to use match and move transition for eye catchy movements in the video.
