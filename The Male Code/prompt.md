✅ UNIVERSAL VIDEO SCRIPT GENERATION PROMPT (TMC – The Male Code Edition)
Prompt:


```
Write a long, detailed, powerful video script titled: "INSERT_VIDEO_TITLE" for the YouTube channel TMC – The Male Code.

This script should be in a dark, sarcastic, unapologetic, and masculine tone—targeted at men who want to understand and master psychological, emotional, and power dynamics in the real world, especially when dealing with women. The content must be direct, no-fluff, and emotionally raw—as if spoken by a man who’s already seen through the manipulation and emotional traps, and now speaks with calm, lethal clarity.

Avoid all sound cues, voiceover directions, or cinematic embellishments. The script must be plain text and written as if the narrator is speaking directly to the viewer—man-to-man, truth-to-truth.

🔥 Core Tone & Style:
Dark and brutally honest

Sarcastic when mocking weakness or delusion

Masculine, emotionally detached, intellectually sharp

Realistic, not fantasy-based

Grounded in psychological truth and male self-worth

🎯 Message Must Include:
Reinforcement of male emotional strength, self-respect, detachment, and dominance

Exposure of manipulative female behaviors, false signals, and social games

Clear instruction on how to respond with power, not desperation

Encouragement to break free from validation-seeking, weakness, and simping

No hatred or misogyny—only sharp clarity, experience, and insight

💡 Structure Guidelines:
Intro (Branded):

“Welcome to TMC – The Male Code. Where men evolve—mentally, emotionally, and strategically.”

“Today’s lesson is titled: [INSERT TITLE HERE]. Let’s break it down.”

Strong Hook

A direct, gripping truth that slaps the viewer with clarity

No sugarcoating. Speak what most men feel but don’t say out loud

Core Breakdown

Describe the behavior, scenario, or manipulation (e.g., ghosting, hot/cold games, fake rejection)

Expose the psychological truth behind it

Analyze why men fall for it and what it does to their identity

Reversal of Power

Lay out the correct, dominant response

Show the mindset shift: from reactive to detached, from chasing to leading

Use sarcasm or mockery to highlight what not to do

Hard-Hitting Truth Bombs

Include memorable, quote-worthy lines (e.g., “If she’s confused about you, you should be clear about leaving.”)

Reinforce the core lesson with a tone of finality and calm dominance

Outro (Branded)

“This was TMC – The Male Code. If you felt the truth in today’s message, you’re already ahead of 90% of men.”

“Like. Subscribe. And remember—don’t chase approval. Command respect.”
